# advent_of_code_2022
Coding advent calendar puzzles event for 2022: https://adventofcode.com/2022

This event was created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz), and this repository holds my submissions for the puzzles. Each day, a puzzle will unlock, and I will complete it using the magic of Python.
